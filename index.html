    <h1>Cities you lived in</h1>
   <p> 
       I always lived in the Bronx with my parents. Later I was able to buy a house in Yonkers.
       Then in the military I met a friend from Hawaii and I went to visit her.
   </p> 
   <ul>
        <li>Bronx</li>
        <li>Yonkers</li>
        <li>Hawaii </li>

    </ul>
    <h1>Cities I would like to visit</h1>
    <p>I would like to visit France because I would like to see Paris.  
        To Bahamas I would like to go because coworkers I heard the beaches are beautiful.  </p>
    <ol>
        <li>France</li>
        <li>Bahamas</li>
    </ol>
